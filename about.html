			<p>NGSI was set up in January 2013. Biodiversity in Newcastle had been declining for several years. Insects in
				particular had declined dramatically in number.
				Loss of insects, including bees and butterflies, was having an effect on numbers of flowers, birds, bats and
				other wildlife in the city.
				NGSI was founded with the aim of halting or reversing this decline. We decided to start by introducing more
				wild flowers to the urban landscape.
				Wild flower meadows themselves have declined by 97% since the Second World War. All animal life, including
				human life, ultimately depends upon plant life.
			</p>
			<p>
				We share Sir David Attenborough's concern that so many urban children are growing up with so little contact
				with nature.
			</p>
			<h1>The overall objectives of NGSI are:</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>To enhance the appearance and biodiversity of all green spaces, and more specifically, land in Newcastle
					to which the public has access, by creating wild flower rich areas.
					In the main, this will be on land managed by the local authority.</li>
				<li>To raise awareness of the value of and encourage the planting of shrubs and trees.</li>
				<li>To establish and maintain constructive relationships with local authority officers and elected
					councillors.</li>
				<li>To foster in children and young people a sense of curiosity and appreciation of the flora and fauna of
					their local neighbourhood.</li>
				<li>To work towards the elimination of the use of synthetic pesticides such as glyphosate on public land,
					except in restricted circumstances.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1>We will achieve these objectives through:</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Establishing on parts of some green spaces, with the agreement of the owning body, wild flower plots
					which will be actively managed for nature.
					This will involve consultation with local residents, introducing suitable wild flowers, and sympathetic
					cutting regimes. </li>
				<li>Planting shrubs and trees in as many appropriate places as possible. </li>
				<li>Participating, where appropriate, in local groups such as "Residents Associations" and "Friends" groups.
				</li>
				<li>Involving local schools and other educational establishments in nature projects.</li>
				<li>Raising public awareness about the spraying of pesticides on green amenity spaces. Lobbying the Council
					to use other safer methods to control vegetation.</li>
			</ul>
