			<p>There are three basic types of wildflower area. They can be combined on one plot.
			</p>

			<h1>Tussock grass area:</h1>


			<p>This is an area of grass that is not cut every year. The grass is allowed to die back naturally at the end
				of each growing season.
			</p>
			<p>The species that can be introduced into this habitat include teasel, yarrow, knapweed, tansy and plantain.
				Once established, these plants are able to compete with long grass.
				Knapweed is particularly good and is an important source of food for several species of butterfly.
			</p>
			<p>Pros: The uncut vegetation provides an over-wintering habitat for butterflies and other insects. It enables
				them to complete their life cycle from egg to adult.
				Seeds that remain on plants such as thistles and plantains provide food for birds through the winter.
			</p>
			<p>Cons: Some members of the public may complain that it looks too untidy. It may need some management if docks
				and/or thistles become too dominant.
			</p>

			<h1>Cornfield annuals:</h1>

			<p>These provide a good floral display, as well as being a good food source for insects and birds. Species in
				this category include cornflowers, corn marigold, corn cockle, corn chamomile and poppies.
			</p>
			<p>Seeds need to be sown on bare crumbly soil. The flowers will not grow in existing grass. Turf should be
				removed or turned over. The sowing can be done in late April or early May.
				Sowing at other times is also possible.
			</p>
			<p>Pros: Flowers tend to be large and colourful, popular with the public. Good supply of pollen and nectar for
				insects, followed by seeds throughout autumn for birds.
			</p>
			<p>Cons: A lot of work is involved. The plants are annuals and may have to be resown every year.
			</p>


			<h1>Meadow flowers:</h1>

			<p>The seeds should be sown in the autumn or early winter, into bare patches among existing grass. Cut the
				grass short and then rake or harrow it (use a cultivator tool).
				Bare soil can be exposed by creating divot marks using the heel of a boot or a spade.
			</p>
			<p>The key species is yellow-rattle. This is an annual flower. It is semi-parasitic and suppresses the growth
				of coarse grasses. This allows more light to reach other meadow flower species.
				Providing fresh yellow rattle seed gets a prolonged period of chilling over winter, followed by moisture and
				sunlight in spring, the plant germinates well.
			</p>
			<p>Cut grass again in Spring (late March) and remove cut grass. The meadow should be cut or strimmed again at
				the end of August or in September, once the wild flowers have set seed.
				The vegetation should be allowed to lie for a couple of weeks to allow seeds to fall, then collected and
				taken to a recycling depot.
			</p>
			<p>Once yellow-rattle is well established, gradually add more meadow flower species to the area, e.g.
				eyebright, stitchwort, speedwells, oxeye daisy, greater trefoil, clovers.
				Perennials benefit from the grass being kept short in their first year, while they are establishing their
				root systems.
			</p>
			<p>Pros: Should provide a good food source, consisting of nectar and pollen, for bees, butterflies and other
				pollinating insects, throughout the summer.
			</p>
			<p>Cons: Requires a lot of work setting up.
			</p>


			<h1>General:</h1>


			<p>Some species will need to be controlled by manual weeding to stop them from colonising large areas. These
				species include ragwort, docks, thistles and creeping buttercup.
				These species are all valuable food sources for insects so should not be removed entirely.
			</p>
			<p>It is necessary to contact local councillors before starting a wild flower project on public land. You will
				also need to contact the local council and gain their permission to manage a wildflower plot.
			</p>
			<p>The local schools may like to be involved. Perhaps the children can help with sowing the wild flower seeds
				and trampling them in. Nature walks with the children around the neighbourhood of the school
				could be arranged.
			</p>
			<p>These are only suggestions. Other methods and sowing seeds at different times to ones we have suggested are
				possible.
			</p>



			<h1>Step by step guide for creating wild flower areas on existing amenity grass.</h1>
			<br>

			<p> 1. Find a suitable site. You do not want it to be too large to start with. Perhaps 10m X 5m would be big
				enough. Choose
				a site that is not directly in front of a row of houses.</p>
			<p> 2. Contact Your Homes Newcastle by telephone. Find out who is responsible for managing the land where you
				wish to have
				the plot.</p>
			<p> 3. Ask if they will visit the proposed site with you. Discuss how you would manage the wild flower plot.
			</p>
			<p> 4. Ask who does the grass cutting for YHN. It will probably be Newcastle City Council. Contact them and
				make sure they
				know about the plot. Decide how to mark the perimeter of the plot so that the men on the mowing machines
				know where it
				is. I leave a border of longer grass. White marker soon disappears.</p>
			<p> 5. If you get the go ahead, leaflet some nearby homes. Explain what you propose doing, what you hope to
				achieve, and how
				the plot will be managed. Give a contact email address.</p>
			<p> 6. Meadow flower seeds need to be sown in the autumn � September to November. Yellow-rattle is a vital
				plant to have
				growing on the plot and must be sown at this time. Plugs can be planted from September to April.</p>
			<p> 7. Good seeds can be bought from Kevin Wharf who has a farm at Burradon in Upper Coquetdale. Tel 01669
				6300363. Store
				the seeds in a cardboard box with air holes in a cool room.</p>
			<p> 8. Prepare ground. Cut the grass low. Use a cultivator tool to create places where the seeds will be in
				contact with
				bare patches of soil.</p>
			<p> 9. Cut plot again in early April � not too low. You will need to do some weeding through the year � docks
				mainly.
				Also keep on top of creeping thistle if that is present.</p>
			<p>10. If you have sown cornfield annuals or plugs you may need to water the ground until the plants are
				established.</p>
			<p>11. Cut plot in September, October or November. Remove cuttings.</p>
			<p>12.You can add seeds to the plot year by year if you think this is necessary.</p>
